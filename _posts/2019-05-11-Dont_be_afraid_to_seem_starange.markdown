Hi, all!

When being a child, I was never afraid of saying my hilariously stupid ideas aloud.
Yet no one joined me on making unicorn hats for street cats, so they would have
the coolest party ever (luckily, today I have a niece to mess around with).
Still there are so many people around asking me questions like "What for?" or
"Do you really have time for THAT?".

This time it all started the same.

Another lovely sunny morning was ruined by annoying pigeons trying to make a nest
at my balcony and inevitably covering floor with,.. you know,.. byproducts.
Angrily screaming and shooting from my water gun to make them fly away
I came up with another strange idea: why don't I build a smart device to track them?
At first, I was thinking about creating an Artificial Intelligence (AI)
to detect them on videostreams. But then the basic idea started to grow: how about
a small movable droid (on raspberry PI?) with camera and (yes) a water gun, that can be
controlled from an iPhone? Isn't it a nice toy to play with? So you would be able to
aim while sitting in the living room. And it can inform owner about birds on the balcony!

"But, hey, why don't you just set a net?" - you may ask. Well, that does not sound as
exciting as my idea. Also, I don't have an intention to harm pigeons
(even after months of scrubbing the floor).

To conclude, I am not sure about building the drone (although my colleagues were
interested and even sent me a [video](https://youtu.be/EzOMIqlDnWo) how to make one).
But I am into building in AI to detect birds on videostreams, so come here sometime to
check my progress! Who knows, maybe it will be more effective during the
[magpie season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj9O6tyKK-o) in Australia.

So, if you came up with some brilliant but crazy idea, why don't you give it a try?
