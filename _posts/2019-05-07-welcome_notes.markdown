Hi, everyone!

Whenever you are a computer geek or a curious capybara, you are welcome here!
Take a seat, make yourself a cup of tea and join me on my virtual adventures
and my endless search of new knowledge.

Just wanted to make it clear: if you are infinitely looking for ways to
sharpen your skills, you are awesome! High Five!
