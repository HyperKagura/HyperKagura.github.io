Hi, Everyone!

My nickname is HyperKagura and I am a Software Engineer and sometimes a Data Scientist. In 2015 I have finished one of top50 Universities in field of Math and Computer Science, so yeah, I do speak a lot of antique languages like Prolog (oh my!), and Perl, and even a bit of Assembley(!!). But let's be honest: it is crucial to keep your skills up to date and invest in self-development. So here they are: some stories from my IT-life and how-not-to-suck guides. Hope you will enjoy reading!
